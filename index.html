      <p>Lightsabers
        i personally love lightsabers,
        They are a great addition to the Film and make it really clear to the viewers,
        that its in the future or an other galaxy. They make it look like its a Sci-Fi Movie.

      <h3>The Storyline of star wars is great, it gives the characters very good backstories and
        they really match with the behaviour of the various characters.
      </h3>

        I really love how the actors of the characters are really fitting into
their role and how they play it, they give alot of personality

Star wars is a great series of movies wich resembles a way humanity could evolve

        for a long time
